# Introduction  webrtc_native_peerconnection_demo

This code repository was written by me to do some experiments with WebRTC. It is known that the WebRTC project is extremely hard to integrate with other projects. I have spent weeks extracting the peer connection source from the WebRTC source tree. In order to integrate our own QT project, I also wrote a client version based on QT.

# How to build (Linux only, Ubuntu 18.04 is prefered)

After cloning the respository, go insdie the directory:

```bash
cd webrtc_native_peerconnection_demo
```

Then:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then the binary is built successfully.

# How to run


# Final

I wrote the README.md very soon, some other details are not covered. If you have other issues, please file an issue. Thanks very much.
